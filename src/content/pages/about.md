title: About Equili
---

Welcome to Equili, formerly LadyCoders, an organization of change makers. Equili brings diversity to the tech industry through speaking engagements, workshops, transformative events, app challenges, content and community building. Equili is built on the notion that a stronger, more diverse community is better for everyone — better ideas, more revenue, more stability, more innovation. At Equili, we are leading a strong, but quiet revolution. We are the change needed in the technology industry.

Equili was originally born as LadyCoders and through a long series of events and epiphanies it became Equili. Our mission is to build a more diverse tech community that levels the playing field for all underrepresented and underutilized groups in technology. How do we do this? Equili provides the vision, information, and execution to help you, your business, and your community affect change immediately.
