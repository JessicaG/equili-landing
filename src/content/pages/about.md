---

Welcome to Equili, formerly LadyCoders, an organization of change makers. Equili brings diversity to the tech industry through speaking engagements, workshops, transformative events, app challenges, content and community building. Equili is built on the notion that a stronger, more diverse community is better for everyone — better ideas, more revenue, more stability, more innovation. At Equili, we are leading a strong, but quiet revolution. We are the change needed in the technology industry.

Equili was originally born as LadyCoders and through a long series of events and epiphanies it became Equili. Our mission is to build a more diverse tech community that levels the playing field for all underrepresented and underutilized groups in technology. How do we do this? Equili provides the vision, information, and execution to help you, your business, and your community affect change immediately.

## Founder Bio

Elaine Marino spearheaded a movement to transform diversity in the tech space as Founder of Equili, CoDiv and the LadyCoders Conference. As a former Ruby on Rails developer, she experienced the tremendous diversity gap in software development: women and people of color were woefully underrepresented. Elaine saw clearly how change could be made for the better with her unique perspective on the tech industry as both an insider and an outsider. At Equili, she designs, implements, and manages events, workshops, and content aimed at bringing more diversity into the tech arena. As the Founder of CoDiv she co-created a community organization providing a safe space to learn, share and support people who care about diversity and inclusion. As Founder of the LadyCoders Conference, she helps women and non-binary technologists who are on the front lines of tech’s diversity and inclusion problem thrive in their careers and stay in the industry. In 2018 she was the recipient of the Micki Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award from SIM Women for her work mentoring women in tech. Elaine is an accomplished public speaker and an alum of Georgetown University.
